## Description:
    This app was created using MySQL, Node.js, Heroku, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, and GitHub. The goal was to create an app that allowed a user to input different types of burgers then decide if they want to eat them/push over to the devoured section which also removed them from the created section. It utilizes the MVC approach, RESTFUL API, and CRUD methods.
